A company operates a retail business that involves the management of various
products and their inventory. As the business grows, it has become increasingly
important to have a robust stock management system in place. To achieve this,
develop a Stock Management CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations
project. The purpose of this project is to enable efficient tracking, updating, and
maintenance of stock-related information.
Basic functionalities:
● An Admin can add new products to the inventory by providing details such
as product name, category, description, price, quantity, and other relevant
attributes.
● A Staff can only view the products.
Key Features:
In addition to the basic CRUD operations, the project should also include the
following features:
● Authentication and Authorization: Implement a user authentication system
to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and modify the stock
inventory.
● Establish role-based access control, differentiating between Admins and
Staffs.
